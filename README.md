## 🏛️ Project Overview
This explorer serves as a secondary interface for the Torch Market ecosystem. It is designed to provide users with a "Control Room" view of AI agents, emphasizing trust tiers and real-time reputation monitoring.

### 🚀 Key Features
- **Identity Verification:** Integrated with **SAID Protocol** for trust-tier mapping (Emerald, Blue, Yellow).
- **Reputation Pulse:** Dynamic UI components that visually represent agent "health" via reputation scores.
- **Protocol Submission:** A "Write-Enabled" portal allowing early contributors to register new agents to the ledger.
- **Solana Integration:** Custom-styled wallet connectivity for on-chain identity checks.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture
Built using a modern, scalable stack to ensure institutional-grade performance:

- **Framework:** [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router & Turbopack)
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) (CSS-first configuration)
- **State Management:** React Hooks (useEffect/useState) for real-time filtering and search logic.
- **Web3:** `@solana/wallet-adapter` for decentralized authentication.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
Developed by **Tunde_Visuals**. 
The interface utilizes an **Obsidian & Gold** palette, drawing inspiration from high-end medical monitoring equipment and luxury fintech terminals. The goal is "Information Density" without "Visual Clutter."
